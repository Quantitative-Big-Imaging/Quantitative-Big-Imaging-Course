### Quantitative Big Imaging Course
Here are the lectures, exercises, and additional course materials corresponding to the spring semester 2014 course at ETH Zurich, 227-0966-00L: Quantitative Big Imaging. 
The lectures have been prepared and given by Kevin Mader, Anders Kaestner, Marco Stampanoni, and Maria BÃ¼chner. Please note the Lecture Slides and PDF do not contain source code, this is only available in the handout.

### Exercises
#### General Information
The exercises are based on the lectures and take place in the same room after the lecture completes. 
- For the first 3 exercises, [QBI Install](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~maderk/qbi.zip) is required for starting the exercises and contains Fiji along with a few test datasets.
- For the subsequent exercies, the [script](https://gist.github.com/kmader/9503137#file-download-and-setup) can be run inside Matlab
